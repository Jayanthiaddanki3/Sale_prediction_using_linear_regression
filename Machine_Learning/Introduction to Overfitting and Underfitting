1. True or False: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, including noise. This can lead to poor generalization on new, unseen data.
A: True
2. True or False: Validation curves help in determining the best hyperparameters for a model by plotting the training and testing error against different values of the hyperparameter.
A: True
